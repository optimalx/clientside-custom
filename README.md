# clientside-custom

This was created so I could upload my custom server replacements here, instead of giving individual links out.

To use, simply extract into your addons. Your directory listing should be something like ```/addons/clientside-custom-main/models/```.

```/materials/``` is required unless you subscribe to the addon.

This pack includes:
1. Playermodel replacements (Terror Train, ~~Black Mesa~~, the 4 default T models, Kleiner, Chell, Ghillie Suit).
2. Weapon model replacements (AHG Deagle, AHG Scout, AHG Silenced USP, Crowbar to Scythe)
3. Weapon skin replacements:
 - CSS Scout (red)
 - CSS Deagle (red/black)
 - CSS AWP (black//spec dm)
 - CSS USP (black)
 - Hands (black)
 - Grenades (black) (incen, discombob, smoke)
 - Python (black)
 - M24 (black)
 - Mag Stick (black)

If you do not want something replaced, delete the corresponding files.

If you would like something replaced on the AHG server, let me know (Steam comment/server pm).
