# clientside-custom

This was created so I could upload my custom server replacements here, instead of giving individual links out.

To use, simply extract into your addons. Your directory listing should be something like ```/addons/clientside-custom-main/models/```.

```/materials/``` is required unless you subscribe to the addon.

This pack includes:
1. Playermodel replacements (Terror Train, Black Mesa, the 4 default T models, Kleiner, and Chell).
2. Weapon model replacements (AHG Deagle, AHG Scout, AHG Silenced USP, Crowbar to Scythe)
3. Weapon skin replacements:
 - CSS Scout (red)
 - CSS Deagle (red)
 - CSS AWP (void black//spec dm)
 - CSS USP (void black)
 - Hands (void black)
 - Python (void black)
 - M24 (void black)
 - Mag Stick (void black)

If you do not want something replaced, delete the corresponding files.

If you would like something replaced on the AHG server, let me know (Steam comment/server pm).
