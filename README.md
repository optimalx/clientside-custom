# clientside-custom

This was created so I could upload my custom server replacements here, instead of giving individual links out.

To use, simply extract into your addons. Your directory listing should be something like ```steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\clientside-custom-main\models\```.

```\materials\``` is required unless you subscribe to the addon.

This pack includes:
1. Playermodel replacements (Terror Train, ~~Black Mesa~~, the 4 default T models, Kleiner, Chell, Ghillie Suit, Ghost).
2. Weapon model replacements (AHG Silenced USP, Crowbar to Scythe)
3. Weapon skin replacements:
 - CSS Scout (red)
 - CSS Deagle (red/black)
 - CSS AWP (white)
 - CSS USP (white and red)
 - Hands (black)
 - Grenades (black) (incen, discombob, smoke)
 - Python (black)
 - M24 (Blue Exclusion Zone Camo)
 - M1 Garand (Red Exclusion Zone Camo)

If you do not want something replaced, delete the corresponding files.

If you would like something replaced on the AHG server, let me know (Steam comment/server pm).
